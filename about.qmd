**Background**

I grew up with a love of the outdoors and would eagerly look forward to summers in the Poconos where I would catch salamanders, frogs, and snakes with my siblings. My siblings and I attended a summer camp in Dubois, WY for a few summers which contributed further to my love of the outdoors as I learned how to backpack, fly fish, horseback ride, rock climb etc. My experiences in nature drove me to pursue a STEM degree where I could continue to learn about environmental processes in order to make a difference.

**Educational Journey**

My goal has always been to combine my love for math and science with my passion for understanding how people interact with their environments in different regions. My early experiences in the outdoors drove me to pursue a STEM degree where I could continue to learn about environmental processes in order to make a difference.Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had roles as a Hydrologic Technician and an Assistant Water Resource Engineer, which have provided me with a foundation in fieldwork, data analysis, and environmental modeling.

I have a strong desire to continue learning and exploring which was further cultivated from my Senior Design capstone experience at Mines. I was fortunate enough to work on a water delivery system project for two neighboring villages in Nepal. My team and I were able to fund enough resources to be able to make a trip out there as well which was crucial in determining the final project solution.

**Hobbies and Interests**

I am passionate about science communication and analysis, and I am always looking for ways to share my love of science with others. In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, and spending time with my dog, Homer (named after the poet).

Here are some photos of my favorite adventures:
