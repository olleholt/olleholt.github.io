title: "About Me"
---

I grew up with a love of the outdoors and would eagerly look forward to summers in the Poconos where I would catch salamanders, frogs, and snakes with my siblings. My siblings and I attended a summer camp in Dubois, WY for a few summers which contributed further to my love of the outdoors as I learned how to backpack, fly fish, horseback ride, rock climb etc. My experiences in nature drove me to pursue a STEM degree where I could continue to learn about environmental processes in order to make a difference.

In 2016 I started school at Dickinson College to study Anthropology. During my first year I took calculus and chemistry classes for fun and decided that is where more of my interests were. After my first year of college I moved out to Colorado to pursue Environmental Engineering at Colorado School of Mines. My goal has always been to combine my love for math and science with my passion for understanding how people interact with their environments in different regions.

I have a strong desire to continue learning and exploring which was further cultivated from my Senior Design capstone experience at Mines. I was fortunate enough to work on a water delivery system project for two neighboring villages in Nepal. My team and I were able to fund enough resources to be able to make a trip out there as well which was crucial in determining the final project solution.

I am passionate about science communication and analysis, and I am always looking for ways to share my love of science with others. In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, and spending time with my dog, Homer (named after the poet).
