## ðŸŒ¿ **Background**

I grew up with a love for the outdoors, spending summers in the **Poconos** catching salamanders, frogs, and snakes with my siblings. These early adventures fueled my fascination with nature and shaped my career path. A summer camp in **Dubois, WY** further deepened this love, teaching me how to **backpack, fly fish, horseback ride, and rock climb**. 

These experiences inspired me to pursue a STEM degree where I could combine my curiosity for the environment with my desire to make a meaningful impact.

## ðŸŽ“ **Educational Journey**

My academic and professional journey has always focused on combining my love for **math** and **science** with my passion for understanding how people interact with their environments. Through my studies, I've had the opportunity to explore:

- Environmental processes and data analysis.
- Hands-on problem-solving through fieldwork.
- Designing impactful, sustainable systems.

One of the most transformative experiences was my **Senior Design capstone project** at **Colorado School of Mines**, where my team designed a water delivery system for two villages in **Nepal**. Traveling to Nepal to finalize the solution gave me firsthand insight into the local culture, geography, and needs.

## ðŸ”¬ **My Focus**

I specialize in combining **data science** with **hydrology and environmental engineering** to address real-world environmental issues. My skill set includes:

- **Data Science**: Applying machine learning, statistical modeling, and spatial analysis to environmental datasets.
- **Hydrology and Environmental Engineering**: Managing water resources and creating sustainable solutions.

Iâ€™m passionate about creating workflows and tools that make environmental data more accessible, actionable, and impactful.

## ðŸŒŸ **Beyond Work**

When Iâ€™m not immersed in data, Iâ€™m usually **exploring the outdoors**, reading a good book, or spending time with my dog, **Homer** (named after the poet). I also enjoy connecting with others who share a passion for sustainability and environmental science.

Here are some snapshots from my favorite adventures:
