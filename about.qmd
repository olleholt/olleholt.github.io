## 🌿 **Background**

I grew up with a love for the outdoors, spending summers in the **Poconos** catching salamanders, frogs, and snakes with my siblings. These early adventures fueled my fascination with nature and shaped my career path. A summer camp in **Dubois, WY** further deepened this love, teaching me how to **backpack, fly fish, horseback ride, and rock climb**.

These experiences inspired me to pursue a STEM degree where I could combine my curiosity for the environment with my desire to make a meaningful impact.

## 🎓 **Educational Journey**

My academic and professional journey has always focused on combining my love for **math** and **science** with my passion for understanding how people interact with their environments. Through my studies, I've had the opportunity to explore:

-   Environmental processes and data analysis.
-   Hands-on problem-solving through fieldwork.
-   Designing impactful, sustainable systems.

At Mines, I was able to take a summer field course for my environmental engineering degree. We traveled to sites in Colorado to test various water sources for our client. Our goal was to determine how effective the remediation efforts were for a local mining company. This experience solidified my interest in **fieldwork** and **data collection** and **lab analysis**.

One of the most transformative experiences was my **Senior Design capstone project** at **Colorado School of Mines**, where my team designed a water delivery system for two villages in **Nepal**. Traveling to Nepal to finalize the solution gave me firsthand insight into the local culture, geography, and needs.

These experiences laid the foundation for my current focus on **data science and environmental modeling**, blending fieldwork with cutting-edge technology to solve environmental challenges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔬 **My Focus**

I specialize in combining **data science** with **hydrology and environmental engineering** to address real-world environmental issues. My skill set includes:

-   **Data Science**: Applying statistical modeling and spatial analysis to environmental datasets.
-   **Hydrology and Environmental Engineering**: Managing water resources and creating sustainable solutions.
-   **Fieldwork**: Conducting hands-on research and data collection in diverse environments.

## 🌟 **Beyond Work**

When I’m not immersed in data, I’m usually **exploring the outdoors**, reading a good book, or spending time with my dog, **Homer** (named after the poet). I also enjoy connecting with others who share a passion for sustainability and environmental science.

Here are some snapshots from my favorite adventures:
