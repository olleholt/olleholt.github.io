I was born and raised in Bethlehem, PA and grew up spending time in Wyoming every summer. I grew up with a love for the outdoors and a passion for science. As a child my parents always knew where to find me if it were climbing trees in my backyard or looking for salamanders and frogs in the Poconos.

I am passionate about science communication and analysis, and I am always looking for ways to share my love of science with others. In my free time, I enjoy running, climbing, and spending time with my dog, Homer (named after the poet).
