## Background

-   Lake Tahoe water clarity has been measured since 1967.

-   Clarity is measured as depth using a Secchi disk.

-   California and Nevada, are actively working to restore lake clarity to its historic 97.4 feet.

-   Factors known to influence year-to-year changes in clarity include the magnitude of runoff, the warming of the lake surface and the depth to which the lake mixes in the previous winter.

## Analysis

### Simple Linear Regression model

```         
Call: lm(formula = Secchi_Ave ~ avg_Chla, data = joined)
Residuals:     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max
-12.144  -2.554  -0.314   2.535  18.834
Coefficients:             Estimate Std. Error t value             Pr(>|t|)     (Intercept)  23.0601     0.4660  49.487 < 0.0000000000000002 ***
avg_Chla     -1.9169     0.6615  -2.898              0.00397 **
--- Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1  Residual standard error: 4.258 on 385 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared:  0.02135,  Adjusted R-squared:  0.01881  F-statistic: 8.398 on 1 and 385 DF,  p-value: 0.003971

## Takeaways

-   Chlorophyll only shows a small influence on the variance of clarity

-   look at things that interact with chl

    -   diatoms/zooplankton
