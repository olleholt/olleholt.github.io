Specifically, VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\n\n**Roads**\n\nTo minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, areas near highways will be ignored. Geofabrik's download sites will be used to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (.gpkg file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area. \n\n**Houses**\n\nWe can also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n**Socioeconomic**\n\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019.\n\n**read in and combine the data**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(geodata)\nlibrary(spDataLarge)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#reading in the data with read_stars for the night lights data\nnight_1 <- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\nnight_2 <- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\nnight_3 <- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\nnight_4 <- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\n#combining into one for each date: 02-07\nstars_1 <- st_mosaic(night_1, night_2)\n\n#combining into one for each date: 02-16\nstars_2 <- st_mosaic(night_3, night_4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFirst a blackout mask was created by finding the change intensity from the night light data.

The y ranges are different but overall both plots are skewed to the right and unimodal. The map and the histograms do show that there is more of an impact from the storm for households with incomes less than \\$50,000 annually and a lower impact for blackouts for households. The limitations in the census tract data is that it is voluntary and therefore we do not know if it accurately represents the population as well as it could.\n",
